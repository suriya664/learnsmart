# Quick Fixes Applied - Jan 2025

## ✅ All Issues Fixed Successfully

### 1. Removed "+" Symbol Throughout Site
- **Issue**: Plus symbols appearing in stats and numbers (150,000+, 800+, etc.)
- **Solution**: Removed all "+" symbols from numbers
- **Locations Fixed**:
  - Hero section stats: "150,000+ Students" → "150,000 Students"
  - Course counts: "1,200+ Courses" → "1,200 Courses"
  - Footer text: "150,000+ students" → "150,000 students"
  - All other instances of numbers with "+" symbol
  
### 2. Added More Space Between Menu Links
- **Issue**: Navigation menu links looked cramped
- **Solution**: Increased gap from `0.75rem` to `1.25rem` between menu items
- **File Modified**: `assets/css/style.css`
- **Result**: Menu now has comfortable spacing between Home, Courses, Instructors, About, Blog, Contact

### 3. Removed Empty Space Above Hero Section

- **Solution**: Changed from `margin-top: 80px` to `margin-top: 0` and added `padding-top: 100px`
- **File Modified**: `index.html`
- **Result**: Hero section now starts immediately below navbar without empty space
